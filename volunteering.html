              <p class="lead">Green Riders is a group of people who go on bicycle tours while aiming to have a positive impact on communities and the environment. I joined them in 2019 as we biked 2700+ miles across Europe from France to Romania. Along the way we planted fruit trees, picked up trash, and raised awareness about biking as a form of sustainable transportation. I like to include this experience because I feel it is unique and showcases my passion, dedication to reaching goals, and ability to go out of my comfort zone. I am still involved with this group and will be the official route planner for our next trip down the Pacific coast (once the pandemic is over).</p>

              <p class="lead">I worked with the <a href="https://sustainable.ufl.edu/"; target="_blank"; style="text-decoration: none;">Office of Sustainability</a> under their sustainable transportation program to educate students, fix bicycles, and improve campus infrastructure. I enjoyed this role because it merged my passion for bikes and sustainability, and I was able to help the community through workshops and events focused on sustainable transportation. I also gained experience with GIS software through a project where we mapped the bike racks on campus. Some things that I really enjoyed were communicating with people on the topic of sustainability and teaching about bike safety and maintenance.</p>

I was responsible for planning trash cleanups, organic farm volunteering, and other community service events. This was a valuable experience early on in my college career as I learned how to be a successful leader as an introvert while participating in conservation efforts in the Gainesville community.</p>

              <p class="lead">UF's outdoor club is near and dear to me, since I met most of my friends and have had so many amazing experiences with this club. I had the pleasure of being a club officer this past year, serving as the Gear Shed Manager, where I took inventory of our outdoor gear, discussed COVID guidelines with the other Officers, and purchased new gear for the club. I have also been a trip leader and have led 10+ trips, being responsible for logistics and group safety. Moreover, being a part of this club helped me grow as a person, expanding my horizons and challenging myself.</p>
